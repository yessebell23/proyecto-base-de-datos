<p>I have a 2013 tea burst, I had it a time when I started to hate it. I removed all the pots and caps. I replaced it with the plan old CTS pots and 18 gauge wire. I did orange drop caps with 490s in the front and the back. Tulip Grover tuners #8 strings and now I love my $3,000 buck Standard. It smokes with a fury hand from my Bad Monkey. Hope for me and hope for you.</p>

<p>You MAY have the pickup / pole pieces too close to the strings. Too strong a magnetic field from the pickup can damp the strings and cause odd tones. This may be happening high on the neck because that is where you push the strings close to the pickups. If this is the problem then it is likely to be the neck pickup. People often raise the neck pickup too high in order to get massive output. Easy to check - just back off the pickup height adjusting screws by a couple of turns and see if the problem goes.</p>

<p>I am the original owner of the Heritage Cherry Sunburst finished Les Paul Standard. I own and have played a 1974 Les Paul Custom since high school (class of 1985). I always wanted a Standard and I am so glad I waited. This 2013 model is super versatile with the (4) push/pull potentiometers. When I played one at Sam Ash Music, I just knew this was the Les Paul for me. I absolutely love alnico V magnet pickups. They're my favorites. Well, both the Burstbucker #1 and Burstbucker #2 have alnico V magnets. Not usually a fan of split coil humbuckers, but Gibson did such a great job ensuring the volume doesn't drop out when in single coil mode. The neck pickup tone control for "phase reversal" is really special. I don't even know exactly what "phase reversal" is however what I do know is it provides a very usable tone. The bridge pickup tone control when pulled up sends the signal straight out the input jack bypassing the tone capacitors and the entire circuit for a blistering raw lead tone. All I have done is keep the guitar polished, added pointers to the volume and tone knobs so I can accurately adjust my volume and tone without having to guess, and switched the Grover "Kidney" buttons to genuine Grover "Keystone" buttons as a personal aesthetic appearance. I love this guitar!!</p>

<p>Hi, just got a 2013 Standard (AAA top an dfancy p/u switching etc) - fantastic guitar. However the strings are not grounded to the electrics - I get that high buzzy thing when I'm playing especially with gain ALL THE TIME unless I touch the pickup covers or jack socket. ALL my other guitars ever only have this only when I let go the strings. The Les Paul wiring diagrams "out there" all show a ground wire from the p/u  negative and pot cases etc to the bridge or tail stop, is the new Standard supposed to have this? It's annoying for such a nice guitar.</p>

<p>Well, I had a good surf round, lots of "guitars should be silent - your house needs re-wiring" stuff, but most of the "voice of reason" comments said: "The bridge / strings must be grounded to the pots and pickups and output, if you touch the strings the buzz should stop" and I found some pictures of the new LP wiring PCB thing.</p><p>So, I opened her up and found the stiff grounding wire from the bridge was not connected to the green box grounding terminal. Woohooo! Pushed it back in and all is well. Guitar is silent unless I let go the strings then there's a bit of high buzzy going on just like all my other guitars ever.</p><p>And I also found out that my LP really likes my F*nder Princeton Reverb, which, to be honest, was a surprise.</p>
